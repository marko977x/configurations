RenderFrame
* Apparently it has some content because of enum PeripheralContentStatus.
* You can get a RenderFrame from WebLocalFrame. As well as from routing_id.
  First question, what exactly is WebLocalFrame? How it relates to RenderFrame?
* You can get routing_id based on WebFrame(WebLocalFrame or WebRemoteFrame).
* It is associated with the RenderView, WebView and WebLocalFrame.
* WebView has some main frame.
* It can show virtual keyboard.
* Javascript can be executed within the context of a render frame.
* MainFrame is marked or can be recognized in some way.

The ways to get RenderFrame object from anywhere:
1. There is global map <RenderFrame, WebFrame>, So you can get one from another.
2. Also there is <routing_id, RenderFrame> map.
3. If you're in a different process you can access specific frame using WebRemoteFrame.

Still don't know how is webview related to render_frame.

WebFrame
* WebLocalFrame corresponds to RenderFrameHostImpl and
  WebRemoteFrame corresponds to RenderFrameProxyHost

WebView
* Every webview has/should have attached MainFrame and this frame can be either
  local or remote.
* Zoom, focus, developer tools, context menu, popup menu, visited link state,
  custom colors, visibility, history, session history,
* Every webview has it's own storage namespace id. Is it simple storage?
